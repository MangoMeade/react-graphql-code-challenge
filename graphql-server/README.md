# Astronomer GraphQL Code Challenge

Start your GraphQL server so you can connect to it the client.

### System Requirements:

- NPM & Node
- Yarn

### Installation + Local Dev:

`cd graphql-server`

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Run `yarn start`

API is available @ `http://localhost:4000`

3. Move onto `react-client` for next steps.

**Note:** You're not required to change anything in the server, but you wish to, you're more than welcome to do so.
